# System Threat Modeling

## System Modeling Types

- **Data Flow Diagram (DFD)**: A DFD represents how data flows within a system, making it easier to identify data-related threats.
- **Attack Trees**: Attack trees depict possible attack paths and how they can be exploited.
- **Data Model**: A data model focuses on how data is structured and stored within the system.
- **Adversarial Modeling**: Adversarial models help identify and analyze potential threats from a malicious actor's perspective.

## Building System Models

- Start by defining the system's boundaries and its components.
- Create visual representations such as diagrams or charts to illustrate the system's architecture.
- Identify data flows, trust boundaries, and interfaces between components.

## Properties of a Good System Model

- **Completeness**: The model should encompass all significant aspects of the system.
- **Consistency**: The model should maintain logical consistency, avoiding contradictions.
- **Clarity**: It should be easily understandable by stakeholders.
- **Relevance**: Focus on aspects that are pertinent to the security of the system.

## A Generalized Approach to Threat Modeling

- **Identification**: Identify assets, adversaries, and potential vulnerabilities.
- **Enumeration**: Enumerate potential threats by considering known attack patterns and attacker motivations.
- **Evaluation**: Evaluate threats based on the impact and likelihood.
- **Mitigation**: Propose countermeasures to address identified threats.

## Learning to Threat Model

- Familiarize yourself with threat modeling methodologies like STRIDE (Spoofing, Tampering, Repudiation, Information Disclosure, Denial of Service, Elevation of Privilege) and DREAD (Damage, Reproducibility, Exploitability, Affected Users, Discoverability).
- Practice on simplified systems to develop your threat modeling skills.

## Threat Modeling on Your Own

- Start by defining your system's boundaries, components, and data flows.
- Consider common threats relevant to your system type.
- Use tools like Microsoft Threat Modeling Tool or OWASP Threat Dragon to assist you.

## Checklists for Diving In Threat Modeling

- Follow a checklist to ensure you don't miss essential steps in the threat modeling process.
- Checklists may include identifying assets, evaluating attack surfaces, and considering data flows.

## Brainstorming Your Threats

- Brainstorm with a team to identify potential threats from different perspectives.
- Consider external and internal threats, human errors, and technical vulnerabilities.

## Structured Approaches to Threat Modeling

- **Microsoft's STRIDE/DREAD**: This methodology classifies threats based on categories (Spoofing, Tampering, Repudiation, Information Disclosure, Denial of Service, Elevation of Privilege) and uses a scoring system (Damage, Reproducibility, Exploitability, Affected Users, Discoverability).
- **OWASP Risk Rating Methodology**: The Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) provides a structured approach to assess risks associated with web applications.

Remember to review these notes and complement them with additional materials and practical examples for a comprehensive understanding of system threat modeling. Mastery of this subject is crucial for effective security assessment and risk mitigation in software development and IT environments.
