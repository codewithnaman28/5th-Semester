## Uncertainity ##

- In real life, it is not always possible to determine the state of the environment as it might not be clear. Due to partially observable or non-deterministic encironments, agents may need to handle uncertinity.
- When an agent knowss enoufh facts about its environment. The logical plans and actions produces a guaranteed work.
- Unforunately, agent never have access to the

**Causes:**

- `Uncertain Data:` Data that is missing, unreliable, incosistent or noisy.
- `Uncertain Knowledge:` When the avialable knowledge has multiple causes leading to multiple effects or incomplete knowledge of causality in the domain.
- `Uncertain Knowledge Representation:` The representation which provides a restricted model of the real system, or has limited expressiveness.
- `Inference:` In case of incomplete or defaule reasoning methods, conclusions drawn might not be completely accurate.

- Knowledge represntation in propositional logic and predicate logic is based on certainity, means we are sure about predicates.
- Example: A->B means if A is true the B is true.
- But what about the situation where we are not sure about whether A is true or not then we can not express it.
