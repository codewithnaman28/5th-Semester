## AI Problems ##

- Problem is defined by its elements and their relations.
- To provide a formal description of a problem, we need to do following things:
  - Define the **state space** that contains all the possible configurations of the relevant objects, including some impossible ones.
  - Specify one more states that describe possible situations , from which problem solving process may start. These states are called **initial state**.
  - Specify one or more states that would be acceptable solution to the problem. THese states are called **goal state**
  - Specify a **set of rules** that describe the actions (operators) available

## Water Jug Problem in Artificial Intelligence - State Space Search ##

*You are given two jugs, a 4-liter one and a 3-liter one. Neither has any measuring markers on it. There is a pump that can be used to fill the jugs with water. How can you get exactly 2-litres of water into a 4-liter jug.*

## The Missionaries and Cannibals: A classic AI problem ##

**On one bank of a river are three missionaries and three cannibals. There is one boat available that can hold up to two people and that they would like to use to cross the river. If the cannibals ever outnumber the missionaries on either of the river's banks, the missionaries will get eaten. How can the boat be used to safely carry all the missionaries and cannibals across the river?**
