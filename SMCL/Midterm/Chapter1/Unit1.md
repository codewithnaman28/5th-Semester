# Basics of Security

- Security refers to measures taken to protect systems, data, and information from unauthorized access, damage, or theft.
- It encompasses a range of practices, technologies, and policies to safeguard assets.

## Principles of Information and Security Management

- Information security management involves principles like confidentiality, integrity, and availability (CIA):
  - **Confidentiality:** Ensures that data is accessible only to authorized users. This principle is fundamental in keeping sensitive information private.
  - **Integrity:** Guarantees the accuracy and trustworthiness of data. It focuses on maintaining data consistency and preventing unauthorized alterations.
  - **Availability:** Ensures that data is available when needed. This principle aims to prevent service disruptions and maintain system functionality.

## Need for Security

- The need for security arises from various threats and risks:
  - **Threats:** Potential dangers to the security of information, such as hackers, malware, or physical theft. These threats can exploit vulnerabilities.
  - **Attacks:** Actual attempts to exploit vulnerabilities and compromise security. Attacks can lead to data breaches or system disruptions.

## Planning for Security

- Planning is crucial for effective security management.
- It involves identifying assets to protect, assessing risks, and developing strategies to mitigate threats.

## The Role of Planning

- Planning sets the foundation for security efforts.
- It helps allocate resources, establish priorities, and guide security measures. An effective plan ensures that security investments are targeted where they are needed most.

## Information Security Governance(1)

- Governance involves defining roles and responsibilities for security management.
- It ensures that security policies and practices align with an organization's goals. Governance also enforces accountability in the management of security resources.

## Information Security Policy, Standards, and Practices

- **Policies:** Policies are high-level documents that outline security objectives. They provide guidance on what should be protected and why it is important.
- **Standards:** Standards provide specific guidelines for implementing policies. They detail the precise steps or measures to be taken to meet policy objectives.
- **Practices:** Practices involve the actual methods and processes used to secure information. These are the tangible steps taken to implement policies and standards.

## Planning for Information Security Implementation

- Implementation is the practical application of security measures.
- It involves translating policies and standards into actionable steps. Implementation ensures that security measures are put into practice effectively.

## Types of Information Security Policy

- Information security policies can cover various aspects of security:
  - **Access Control:** Defines who can access specific resources and under what conditions.
  - **Data Protection:** Specifies how sensitive data should be handled, stored, and transmitted.
  - **Network Security:** Outlines measures to secure the network infrastructure, such as firewalls and intrusion detection systems.

## Guidelines for Effective Policy

- Effective policies are clear, comprehensive, and tailored to an organization's needs.
- They should be regularly reviewed and updated to address evolving threats. Effective policies help in ensuring that security objectives are met consistently.

## Information Security Roles

- Different roles exist in the field of information security:
  - **Security Analysts:** Analyze security threats and vulnerabilities and implement security measures.
  - **Security Administrators:** Manage security systems, enforce policies, and handle security incidents.
  - **Security Managers:** Oversee the overall security strategy and manage security teams. They are responsible for setting security policies and ensuring compliance.

## Security Education, Training, and Awareness Program

- Security awareness programs educate employees about security risks and best practices.
- Training equips staff with the skills and knowledge to protect against threats. Training can include recognizing phishing emails or using secure passwords.
- These programs are vital for fostering a security-conscious culture in organizations. An informed and trained workforce is a significant asset in safeguarding an organization against security threats.

## Security - the quality or state of being secure

`Protection from adversaries - those who would do harm intentionally or otherwise - is the ultimate objective of security.`
Multiple layers of security in place to protect its operations:

- **Physical Security:** Physical security measures are designed to prevent unauthorized access to facilities, equipment, and resources.
- **Personnel Security:** Personnel security measures are designed to ensure that only authorized individuals have access to resources.
- **Information Security:** Information security measures are designed to protect data and information systems from unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification, or destruction.
- **Network Security:** Network security measures are designed to protect the network infrastructure and its services from unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification, or destruction.
- **Communication Security:** Communication security measures are designed to protect the confidentiality and integrity of information as it is transmitted between systems.
- **Operations Security:** Operations security measures are designed to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information as it is processed, stored, or transmitted.

## CIA Triangle

- It is the security standard for computer security since the development of mainframe.
- The standard is based on three characterstics that describe the utility of information:
  - **Confidentiality**
  - **Integrity**
  - **Availability**

`Security is basically a state of being secure and free form danger or harm. Also, some actions taken to make someone or something secure.`

### Critical Characteristics of Information

#### Confidentiality

Confidentiality refers to prevention of unauthorized disclosure of sensitive information and provides access for authorized users only.

Common threats against confidentiality are:

- Encryption Cracking
- Malicious Insiders
- Man - In - The - Middle Attacks

#### Integrity

Integrity prevents unauthorized or contaminating modification of systems & information. And provides authorized actions by authorized users only. It highlights the basic topic of information trustworthiness.

Challenges that affect integrity of information are:

- Human Error
- Compromising a server where end to end encryption isn’t present
- Physical compromise of a device

#### Availability

Availability means we want to prevent disruption or loss of service and associated productivity and that information, with its integrity in tact and its confidentiality are available to authorized users when and where.

Information unavailability can occur due to:

- Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) Attacks
- Loss of processing ability due to natural disasters
- Malicious Code
- Insufficient Bandwidth

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Principles of Information Security Management

The fundamental principles of information security include:

- Confidientiality
- Privacy
- Quality
- Availibility
- Trustworthiness
- Integrity

## Need for Security: Threats, Attacks

Information security performs four major functions for an organization:

- Protecting the organizations ability to funtion.
- Protecting the data and information.
- Enabling the safe operation of applications running on the organizations IT systems.
- Safegaurding the organizations technology assests.

`Key Terms`

- **attack:** an onging act against an asset that could result in the loss of it's value.
- **exploit:** a vulnerability that can be used to cause a loss to an asset.
- **threat:** a potential risk of an assest's loss of value.
- **threat agent:** a person or other entity that may cause an loss in an assest's value.
- **Vulnerability:** a potential weakness in an assest or it's defensive contorl system(s).

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Security Attacks

- interruption - attack on avalability
- interception - attack on confidentiality
- modification - attack on integrity
- fabrication - attack on authenticity

There are mainly two types of attacks:

- Passive Attack
- Active Attack

**Passive Attack:** These are the types of attack which make use of information from the system but does not affect the system resource.

Example of passive attacks:

- Release of message contents.
- Traffic Analysis.

**Active Attack:** These are the types of attack in which modification of the data stream or the creation of a false stream occur.

Example of active attacks:

- Masquerade.
- Replay.
- Modification of messages.
- Denial of Service.

### Planning for Security of Organisation/Companies/Individuals

`An organization's information security effort needs a policy, standards, practices, and planning for success.`

Having a clear information security policy is crucial for the success of an organization's security efforts. It sets the foundation for the security architecture and guides the creation of standards and practices. Planning plays a key role in ensuring effective resource allocation and preparing for uncertainties.

**Planning Levels:**

1. **Strategic Plan**: This is a document that outlines an organization's long-term goals and strategies for the next several years. It's like a roadmap for where the company wants to be in the future.

2. **Strategic Planning**: The process where senior management decides on the long-term goals, future direction, and resource requirements to achieve those goals. It's about setting the big picture for the organization.

3. **Operational Plan**: This document focuses on an organization's day-to-day activities and goals for the coming months. It's like a detailed plan for how to run the organization on a daily basis.

4. **Operational Planning**: The actions taken by management to set short-term goals and figure out the necessary resources to achieve those goals. It's about managing the day-to-day activities efficiently.

5. **Tactical Plan**: This is a plan for an organization's intermediate-term goals and strategies for the next few years. It bridges the gap between long-term strategic plans and short-term operational plans.

6. **Tactical Planning**: The process where management defines the mid-term goals and plans the allocation of resources to meet these goals. It's about turning long-term strategies into actionable steps for the near future.

### Planning and CISO

- The first priority of the CISO and the information security management team is the
creation of a strategic plan to accomplish the organization’s information security
objectives. While each organization may have its own format for the design and
distribution of a strategic plan, the fundamental elements of planning share
characteristics across all types of enterprises.
- The plan is an evolving statement of how the CISO and various elements of the
organization will implement the objectives of the information security charter, which
is expressed in the enterprise information security policy (EISP).

## Information Security Governance

Governance, in the context of IT security, refers to the process of controlling and managing how an organization achieves its security objectives. It's a strategic function led by senior management to make well-informed decisions that are in the best interest of the organization. In recent years, the importance of governing information security has grown significantly.

To protect valuable information assets, management needs to integrate security practices into the organization's overall strategy. This means expanding corporate governance policies and controls to include security objectives. For effective and sustainable security, it's crucial that information security objectives are a top priority for the organization's senior management.

A comprehensive approach to information security considers not only the protection of digital data but also the knowledge managed by IT assets. In other words, it encompasses safeguarding all the information that's important to the organization, which can be critical for its success and reputation.
