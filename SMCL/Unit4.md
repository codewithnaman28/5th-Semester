**IT Rules Background:**

**New Guidelines for Social Media Intermediaries:**

1. The new rules classify social media intermediaries into two categories: `social media intermediaries` and `significant social media intermediaries`.

   - The above classification is based on the number of users on the platform. A social media intermediary with more than 50 lakh registered users is classified as a significant social media intermediary, and once it has been defined thorugh the notification of the government, it would act as the threshold between the two. This is because there are additional compliance measures for significant social media intermediaries given the large number of users and the volume of content on their platforms.

2. Due diligence to be followed by intermediaries under the new rules.

   - According to the new rules, in case due diligence is not followed by the intermediary, the safe harbor provisions would not apply to them. This means that the intermediary would be liable for any third-party information, data, or communication link made available or hosted by them.

3. Mandatory grievance redressal mechanism.

    - Intermediaries shall appint a grievance officer to deal with complaints and share the name and contact details of such officer.
    - This officer should acknowledge the complaint within 24 hours and resolve it within 15 days from its receipt.

4. Ensuring online saftey and dignity of users.

    - Intermediaries shall remove or disable access to any content within 24 hours of receiving a complaint or a court order.
    - Complaints of such nature can be filed either by the individual or by any other person on their behalf.

5. Additional due diligence for significant social media intermediaries.

    - Significant social media intermediaries shall publish a monthly compliance report mentioning the details of complaints received and action taken on them.
    - They shall also publish a half-yearly compliance report mentioning the details of the complaints received and action taken on them, as well as the number of specific communication links or parts of information that they have removed or disabled access to.

6. Establishing the identity of the originator of the message/content.

    - Such intermediaries offering services chiefly in messaging shall enable the identification of the first originator of the information on their platforms.
    - The purpose of this provision is to enable law enforcement agencies to trace the origin of a message in case of a serious offence.
    - Here, the social media intermediary offering the message services will have a responsibility to enable the identification of the first originator of the information on their platforms helping the law enforcement agencies to trace the origin of a message in case of a serious offence.
    - This can only be executed through an order passed by a court or a competent authority under Section 69 of the IT Act.

**New Guidelines for ott platforms, news publishers and digital media:**

    - The new rules call OTT platforms publishers of online curated content.
    - The would have to self-classify the content into five categories based on age: U (Universal), U/A 7+, U/A 13+, U/A 16+, and A (Adult).

    - Level 3 Oversight mechanism by the Central Government: The Central Government shall establish an Inter-Departmental Committee for hearing grievances.

**New IT Rules Concerns:**
